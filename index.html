		<p class="deathquote">There is no justice; There is only me, Death</p>
		<p>Death is the Disc's personification of death. The very few people that actually saw him described him as "A tall skeletal figure with a black robe and a scythe, galaxies in eyes".</p>
		<p>Only people of magic can see Death, everyone else "felt like there was someone extra in the room, one who caused existential dread, I just coouldn't remember their appearance."</p>
		<p>"It's because your brain beleives that you're not supposed to see Death whilst you're alive, and so your brain refused to notice him," the wizards of the Unseen University explained.</p>
		<p>Death is reported to have a voice like heavy lead plates, that "kinda sounds from within your head."</p>
		<p>The public generaly regards him as a "murderous monster." <text class="death">I do not kill, oh no! I merely lead the souls of the dead to the resting place,</text> Death said.</p>
		<p>Aside of "leading the souls of the dead to the resting place", he was also likely seen to perform hobbies. We have reports of a "mysterious black robed figure, with a voice that kinda sounds from within your head." He was seen making 5 course meals within seconds. When question he simply responded <text class="death">Because time has no meaning to me.</text> He was also reported performing the "no meaning to me" at farms, where he could almost beat an automatic field harvester with just his scythe, cutting individual blades of wheat.</p>
		<p>His main job involves "leading the souls of the dead to the resting place." He sends out many servants to do the job for him, however, wizards, kings, and other people of power bear the right to be collected by Death himself. Furthermore, kings bear the right to be "separated from the mortal realm" by his sword, instead of the usual scythe.</p>
