		<p>Death is the Disc's personification of death. The very few people that actually saw him described him as "A tall skeletal figure with a black robe and a scythe, galaxies in eyes".</p>
		<p>Only people of magic can see Death, everyone else "felt like there was someone extra in the room, one who caused existential dread, I just coouldn't remember their appearance."</p>
		<p>"It's because your brain beleives that you're not supposed to see Death whilst you're alive, and so your brain refused to notice him," the wizards of the Unseen University explained.</p>
